## Why This Project

After years of being an apple fan boy I've had a horrible experience with their support and realised there is nowhere to turn to when apple decides to be unreasonable.

The short of my story is that apple is renegading on its pledge here to replace the defective keyboard on my macbook air:
[https://support.apple.com/en-ca/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks)

This after I lost several days of work booking appointments, going to the apple store multiple times, purchasing a new laptop so I could carry on working etc.  The issue was diagnosed in the shop as falling under the keyboard service program and I waiting a couple more days as it was sent to a specialist repairer.

That is when the crap started.  They claimed there was also water damage and I would have to pay over €600 to fix that before they would replace the defective keyboard. Absolute bullshit!  I have never spilt any liquid on the laptop and the issue I am experiencing is not consistent with water damage but is exactly what thousands of other users of that macbook model have experienced.

- The problem is with random keys repeating when they are struck (so you type 'w' and get 'www').
- The problem happens with keys as far apart as 'w', 'i' and the spacebar. Would have to be very extensive water damage to do this.
- The problem has been gradually getting worse over several months.
- The poor state of the keyboard is obvious from physical examination.

## The plan

I would rather spend €600 generating bad press for apple than be scammed by them.  I have set up this project to make it easy for anyone else who has issues with up to get publicity for it.

I will dedicate about 5 hours every week to promoting this on facebook, linkedin, instagram and twitter.

If you experience bad support from apple please open an issue here.  Every month I will select the #AppleSupportFailOfTheMonth and promote it vigorously till it gets a successful resolution.
